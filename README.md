## üìù Introduction
Teamlinker is a team collaboration platform that integrates multi-functional modules,such as contact, task management, meeting, IM,Wiki and file management.

The platform solves the problem of efficient collaboration within the team and avoids the problem of companies using multiple tools to handle project progress, communication with colleagues and client meetings separately. Compared with traditional tools, Teamlinker not only provides basic and comprehensive collaborative office needs, but also has extremely low cost.

Teamlinker is developed based on the TeamOS system. It is a web operating system that allows users to process different tasks in parallel, similar to operating systems such as Win and Mac. It mainly contains six functional modules: project, wiki, calendar, meeting, chat and network disk. These functions are seamlessly integrated to make team collaboration smoother.
